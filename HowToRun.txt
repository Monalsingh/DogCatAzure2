our name file name should be app.py

our flask instance name should be app
	app:app
create a name file and name it as Procfile 
	note: Procfile should have no extension and P should be in capital case
In Procfile we are suppose to mention commands which will be used by the cloud instance at the time of deployment

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

#steps to push your application from local to heroku cloud
heroku login

heroku create 

git remote -v


git remote add origin remoteurl

git push origin master

# Steps we are following to deploy our app on AWS Elastic BeanStalk

Step1: Your main python file name should be application.py
Step2: Your flask object name, which we have defined in application.py should also be the application. 
Step3: .ebignore  is responsible to hold the name of those files which we don't want to push on a cloud.
Step4: Create a requirements.txt file
        command : pip freeze > requirements.txt
Step5: Create a folder in your application and name it as .ebextensions
Step6: Inside .ebextensions we have to create a new file and name it as python.config
Step7: In python.config we are suppose to mention the below commands
         option_settings:
              "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
                WSGIPath: application:application
